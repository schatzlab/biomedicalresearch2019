# Project Presentations
## Wednesday December 4, 2019

Presentations will be a total of 20 minutes: 15 minutes for the presentation, followed by 5 minutes for questions. We will strictly keep to the schedule to ensure that both groups can present. The order of presentations will be determined in class on Wednesday.


## Recommended outline for your talk (1 minute per slide):

1. Title Slide: Who are you, title, date
2. Intro 1: Whats the big idea???
3. Intro 2: More specifically, what are you trying to learn?
4. Data 1: What data are you looking at?
5. Data 2: Anything notable about the data?
6. Methods 1: What did you try?
7. Results 1: What did you see!
8. Methods 2: What is the key idea?
9. Results 2: Does it work?
10. Methods 3: What else did you try?
11. Results 3: How does it compare to other methods/data/ideas?
12. Discussion 1: What did you learn from this study?
13. Discussion 2: What does this mean for the future?
14. Acknowledgements: Who helped you along the way?
15. Thank you!

I strongly *discourage* you from trying to give a live demo as they are too unpredictable for a short talk. If you have running software you want to show, use a "cooking show" approach, where you have screen shots of the important steps.
