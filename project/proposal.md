  * References to 2 to 3 relevant papers
  * References/URLs to datasets that you will be studying (Note you can also use simulated data)
  * Please add a note if you need me to sponsor you for a MARCC account (high RAM, GPUs, many cores, etc)

Submit the proposal as a single page PDF on GradeScope (each team member should submit the same PDF). Then in class on Wednesday Oct 23, each team will orally present their plan.

formatting as a Bioinformatics article (Intro, Methods, Results, Discussion, References). Word and LaTeX templates are
