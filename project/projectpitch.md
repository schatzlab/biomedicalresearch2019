### Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you'll start to define your research proposal for the semester.
As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/en601452/resources)

### Team assignment

Please mark your preference for the following topics:

#### Team Ancestry Analysis

- Given an unknown sample, determine which country/countries they come from

- Given an unknown sample, find any close relatives within a larger collection of samples

- Identify regions of Neanderthal introgression in an unknown sample

- Develop a tool/webapp to generate PCA plots of how people are related

- Develop a tool/webapp for inferring the [surname](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.long) from a genome.

- Your own idea! Please describe in 5-10 sentences, plus a figure if needed

#### Team Disease Risk

- Develop a pipeline to Evaluate an unknown sample for disease risk using OMIM, Clinvar, and other approaches

- Compare variant calls in GIAB HG002 using Illumina sequencing and PacBio CCS reads for additional disease related variants in OMIM

- Most disease genetics approaches focus exclusively on single nucleotide variations. Develop a pipeline to evaluate impact of structural variations on coding sequence (insertion/deletion of exons, flanking regulatory sequences). Look for common variants in the 1000 genomes project.

- Use OMIM variants to train a classifier (CNN, Random Forest, etc) to recognize clinically relevant variants and test through cross validation

- Develop an algorithm to align repetitive sequences uses high confidence unique markers

- Your own idea! Please describe in 5-10 sentences, plus a figure if needed

### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, your team preference, your project preference, and all relevant figures (as needed).  You do not need to show code for plotting. 
Submit your PDF by uploading the PDF to [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/60230). The Entry Code is: MPK8BX 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 5 late days (120 hours) for the entire semester!
