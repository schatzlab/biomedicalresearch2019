### Assignment Overview

In this assignment you will consider the requirements for sequence alignment.
As a reminder, any questions about the assignment should be posted to [Piazza](https://piazza.com/jhu/fall2019/en601452/resources)

### Question 1: Minimum Alignment Lengths  (10 pts)

Determine how many bases long a given pattern P should be to ensure that occurrences of 
P are unlikely to be chance events (e<.000001) in genomes of the following sizes:

- 1a. 5.2Mb (Bacillus anthracis – the microbe that causes anthrax)
- 1b. 100Mb (Caenorhabditis elegans -  model worm)
- 1c. 3.1Gb (Homo sapiens - human)
- 1d. 18GB (Triticum aestivum – bread wheat)
- 1e. 670Gb (Polychaos dubium – amoeba, has largest known genome)


### Question 2: Edit distance (10 pts)

Compute the edit distance of (a portion of) the human hemoglobin alpha and beta subunits, 
showing the dynamic programming matrix and the aligned sequences. Assume a fixed unit cost 
to substitute one amino acid for another.

	Alpha: 	EALERMFLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSAQVK
	Beta: 	EALGRLLVVYPWTQRFFESFGDLSTPDAVMGNPKVK


### Packaging

The solutions to the above questions should be submitted as a single PDF document that includes your name, email address, and 
all relevant figures (as needed). Make sure to clearly label each of the subproblems and give the exact commands and/or code snippets you used for 
solving the question. You do not need to show code for plotting. 
Submit your solutions by uploading the PDF to [GradeScope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/60230). The Entry Code is: MPK8BX 

If you submit after this time, you will start to use up your late days. Remember, you are only allowed 5 late days (120 hours) for the entire semester!
